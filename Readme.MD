# Purist Mod

This is the raw .rpy file repository for the Purist Mod translation effort.

If you are pushing files for a new translation, please make sure to make a NEW branch for your particular language.

## Mod Setup.

Put modified files in \edits\ and then run pushup.bat
You'll have to download the .rpa archive files from the Google Drive link which can be found here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1efoDS34hklUjg3v_mRmYfDxhW03y2zdh
