# DDLC-Purist
A mod for DDLC completes the TRUE path.

## Cloning the repo for noobies

Use the command "git clone --recursive https://github.com/GarnetSunset/DDLC-Purist" when cloning please!

## Running it.

Setup.bat for now. I'll add a couple steps to migrate your changes manually in the future.
